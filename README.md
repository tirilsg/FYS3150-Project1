## Project1

The code in this repo is organized simply in a c++ .cpp file, as well as a .py pyhon file. We need the outcome of our c++ code to run our python code, so make sure to run the programs in the correct order.

The purpose of these programs is comparing efficiency of algorithms for grneral and spesific solution of the one-dimentional Poissons equation, as well as minimizing errors by comparing these numeric solutions to the exact solution.
